## Simple app to showcase the English and Bulgarian convolutional neural network models

You **don't** need to install Python to use this app. Just run `draw-letters.exe`.

When you start the app a black window will pop up. You can draw a letter by holding the 
_left mouse button_ and moving the mouse. Then you can press `1` on the keyboard to make a prediction
with the _english model_, or press `2` to make a prediction with the _bulgarian model_. After that, 
press any button to clear the prediction.

You exit the app by pressing `esc`.
